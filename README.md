# Matrix Calculations
This repository contains functions for performing matrix calculations in JavaScript.

"mcm.js" provides an answer to the question: "What is the greatest/least number of calculations needed to perform matrix chain multiplication?" It primarily requires a 1-dimensional array as input, populated with the sizes of each matrix that is part of the chain multiplication process. For example, matrices of sizes 7x3, 3x7, 7x4, and 4x3 would have an input matrix of [ 7, 3, 7, 4, 3]. As output, it returns a single integer value representing either the maximum or minimum number of calculations needed to perform matrix chain multiplication on the given matrices.
